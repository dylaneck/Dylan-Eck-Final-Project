My project is fully computed in the Main.ipynb notebook. For testing, I also ran much of the code in main.py while testing it. All of my functions are written out in the utils.py file, though they are not all in order as I had to go back in to add things or fix issues. Each function has a small comment block describing what the function does. I also wrote out most of the split dataframes out to a csv to make sure they work.
